Easily add sub domains to your CakePHP application using route prefixes. Based on [code](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/7140) created by [chinpei215](https://github.com/chinpei215).

## Requirements

* CakePHP 3.3+
* PHP 5.5.9+

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

```
composer require --prefer-dist multidimensional/cakephp-subdomains
```

## Setup


Load the plugin by running following command in terminal:

```
bin/cake plugin load Multidimensional/Subdomains -b -r
```

Or by manually adding following line to your app's `config/bootstrap.php`:

```php
Plugin::load('Multidimensional/Subdomains', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true]);
```

## Configuration

Run the installation script command in termainl:

```
bin/cake SubdomainsInstall
```

This command will allow you to automatically create a configuration file with the list of your subdomains for the plugin to use. You can also run this command to add or delete additional subdomains.

Alternatively, you can create a `config/subdomains.php` file in your main CakePHP config folder:

```php
return array(
    'Multidimensional/Subdomains' => 
        array('Subdomains' =>
			array('{SUBDOMAIN_1}', '{SUBDOMAIN_2}', /*...*/ '{SUBDOMAIN_N}')
		)
	);
```

## Usage

The plugin will automatically add the subdomains you specify as CakePHP prefixes. 

When generating links, include the subdomain prefix you want to use and the Router will automatically create the link using the subdomain URL.

```php
//Link to http://example.com/articles/
$this->Html->link(['prefix'=>false, 'controller'=>'Articles', 'action'=>'index']);

//Link to http://admin.example.com/articles/
$this->Html->link(['prefix'=>'admin', 'controller'=>'Articles', 'action'=>'index']);
```

Please help our project by creating a fork, and sending a pull request.

We need help writing unit tests, implementing Travis-CI and generally improving the functionality of the code.

## To Do

* Travis CI and PHPUnit Testing
